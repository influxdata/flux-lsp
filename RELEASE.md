# How to Update the LSP and its Consumers

This document describes all the steps necessary for updating the Flux LSP and its main consumers. There is also a section at the end that describes how to use some automated helper scripts to streamline the process.

## Prerequisites

Install the following

- Any stable release of Rust >= 1.47
- `npm`
- `wasm-pack`

To install `wasm-pack`, run `make install-wasm-pack` from the project root of `flux-lsp`.

Pull down the most recent versions of the following repos:
- [ `flux-lsp` ](https://www.github.com/influxdata/flux-lsp)
- [ `flux-lsp-cli` ](https://www.github.com/influxdata/flux-lsp-cli)
- [ `flux-lsp` ](https://www.github.com/influxdata/vsflux)
- [ `influxdb` ](https://www.github.com/influxdata/influxdb)
- [ `ui` ](https://www.github.com/influxdata/ui)

## Testing Locally

`cd` into `flux-lsp`.

To test the LSP with a new Flux release, open `Cargo.toml` and look for the `flux` dependency. Replace the `tag` value with the tag for the current Flux release. Run `cargo test` and confirm that all tests pass.

Then, navigate to the `ui` directory in `influxdb`, and open `package.json`. Find the `@influxdata/flux-lsp-browser` dependency, and replace the version number with `file:`, followed by the full file path to the `pkg-browser` directory in the local copy of `flux-lsp`.

Example:

```json
"dependencies": {
    "@influxdata/flux-lsp-browser": "file: /home/janedoe/projects/flux-lsp/pkg-browser"
}
```

Run `yarn add`, then navigate back to the project root and run `make test-js`. Confirm that the tests pass.

### Testing local LSP changes in VS Code (Optional)

After confirming that all the tests pass, run `make wasm` to compile with a docker container, or `make wasm-local` to compile locally. This will create two directories: `pkg-node` and `pkg-browser`. Each is a ready-to-publish npm package for different wasm compilation targets.

Navigate to the `vsflux` repo, and open `package.json`. Find the `@influxdata/flux-lsp-node` dependency, and replace the version number with `file:`, followed by the full file path to the `pkg-node` directory in the local copy of `flux-lsp`. It should look something like:

```json
"dependencies": {
    "@influxdata/flux-lsp-node": "file: /home/janedoe/projects/flux-lsp/pkg-node"
}
```

Then, from the root of `vsflux`, run `npm install`. 

Finally, open up the `vsflux` project in VS Code, click on the `Run` tab in the sidebar, and then click the green arrow at the top of the pane. This should open up a new VS Code window that is running the local version of the extension, rather than the one available on the marketplace. Confirm that any recent changes are working as expected.

## Cutting a release

When the `master` branch of the `flux-lsp` is ready for a release, pull down the latest changes from GitHub, and do the following:

### Increment the version

Bump the version number listed near the top of `Cargo.toml`. You can do this by hand, but it is better to use a tool like [`cargo bump`](https://github.com/wraithan/cargo-bump). You can install it through cargo with 
```
cargo install cargo-bump
```

Once installed, use one of the following commands to programatically bump the version:

- `cargo bump patch` for a patch release (example: `0.5.20 -> 0.5.21`)
- `cargo bump minor` for a minor release (example: `0.5.xx -> 0.6.0`)
- `cargo bump major` for a major release (example: `0.5.xx -> 1.0.0`)

Checkout a new branch and commit the `Cargo.toml` change. Open a pull request to master, and wait for it to merge.

Once it has merged, pull down a fresh copy of master. Find the commit hash with the version change, and add a tag that consists of the new version number prepended with a `'v'` (example: `v0.5.20`). Git will open a prompt to include a message with the tag, which should just be `"Release <tag-name>"`.

As an example, if the new version was version `0.5.21`, all of this could be done with the following command:

```
git tag -a -s v0.5.21 <commit hash> -m "Release v0.5.21"
```

Push the tag to `master` by running `git push origin master <tag-name>`

Confirm that the both of the following have occurred:

1. The tag has been pushed to the master branch of the GitHub repo.

2. CircleCI has detected the version tag, and has triggered a job that will build the [ `flux-lsp-node` ](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@influxdata/flux-lsp-node) and [ `flux-lsp-browser` ](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@influxdata/flux-lsp-browser) packages and deploy them to `npm`.

The last thing to do for the `flux-lsp` repo is to cut a release on GitHub. Go to the [GitHub repo](https://www.github.com/influxdata/flux-lsp) and click on the `Releases` link and draft a new release with the tag that was just pushed. The title should be the same as the messaage included with the tag (e.g. `Release v0.5.21`), and the description should include a brief summary of the changes made since the last release.

### Update the CLI and the VS Code Extension

In both `flux-lsp-cli` and `vsflux`, update the `flux-lsp-node` dependency to the latest version in `package.json`, then run `npm install`. 

Then, increment the version number using the following command:

`npm version <patch|minor|major> --no-git-tag-version`

From this point on, the process should be virtually identical to cutting a release of the LSP itself:

- Commit the changes to a new branch, and open a pull request to `master`, and wait for it to merge.
- Pull down a fresh copy of master, and add the version tag to the relevant commit.
- Push the tag up to GitHub, and mark a release.

Like `flux-lsp`, `flux-lsp-cli` and `vsflux` both have CircleCI jobs that will take care of deploying them once the version tag is detected. Still, it is good practice to confirm that the new versions have been deployed to [ NPM ](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@influxdata/flux-lsp-cli) and the [ VS Code Extension Marketplace ](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=influxdata.flux).

### Update InfluxDB & UI

The last thing to do is to pull down a fresh copy of both [`influxdb`](https://github.com/influxdata/influxdb) and [ `ui` ](https://github.com/influxdata/ui).

Open up `package.json` in `ui` and update the `flux-lsp-browser` dependency to the latest version for both files. Run `yarn add`, commit the changes, run the tests with `yarn test` to confirm nothing has broken, and open a PR into `master`.

The process for `influxdb` should be the same, with the exception that all these steps should be done within the `ui` directory.

### Automating the release

Some small scripts have been written to streamline some of the more tedious parts of the release process. As a result, many of the steps described above can be taken care of by running a few commands.

In order for the scripts to work, the [ hub command line tool ](https://github.com/github/hub) must be installed.

When a release of the LSP is ready to be made, checkout the master branch and make sure the working tree is clean (the script will exit early if it's not).

Then, run `make patch-version` or `make minor-version` depending on the type of release required.

This command will do a few things:

- Run some checks before executing the body of the script:
	- Is `hub` installed?
	- Is the `master` branch checked out?
	- Are there any uncommitted changes?
	- Is the local `master` branch ahead of the `remote`?
- Pull down a fresh copy of `master`
- Bump the version number in `Cargo.toml`
- Checkout a new branch called `bump-version` and push it to GitHub
- Create a pull request from `bump-version` to `master` and open it in a browser window

Once that PR has been merged, pull down a fresh copy of `master` and run `make tag-release` from the master branch. This will perform the same checks as the last command. Then, it will tag the current commit, push it to GitHub (which will trigger the CI Job that publishes to NPM), and open a prompt for the user to describe major chages since the last release.

When this is done, run `make [patch|minor]-version` in both `vsflux` and `flux-lsp-cli`. This will create a PR for the `bump-version` branch into master, just like in `flux-lsp`. Then, follow the steps outlined above to update the `flux-lsp-node` version inside `package.json` for both repos. Push that change up to both `bump-version` PRs.

Once they've merged, checkout master, pull down the changes, and run `make tag-release`.

There is not currently a way to automate upgrading the lsp verion in `influxdb` or `ui`
